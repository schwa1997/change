## Title

A Comprehensive Study on Vowel Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks for Individuals with Speech Disorders in the Italian Language

## Abstract

Abstract: This study addresses the issue of speech and listening impairments, highlighting the potential for improvement through targeted training. The University of Padua's Computer Engineering Lab is developing an online service, SoundRise, to help individuals refine their pronunciation skills. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for identifying vowel pitch and volume through audio analysis. As artificial intelligence continues to gain attention and improve various industries, this thesis aims to investigate the feasibility of integrating AI into this training service SoundRise. By incorporating AI training into vowel recognition, this thesis seeks to contribute to speech rehabilitation, offering a direct approach to learning and evaluating speech. This research explores vowel recognition in Italian using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and introduces a new dataset covering five vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/) for future applications. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this system in recognizing vowel types, potentially enhancing outcomes for individuals with speech disorders.
