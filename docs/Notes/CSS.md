## Fundamentals
### 1. **Box Model**

The CSS box model defines how the size of a box (element) is calculated:

- **Box Types**:
  1. **Content Box**: The default box model where `width` and `height` properties include only the content. Padding, border, and margin are added outside this box.
  2. **Padding Box**: Includes the content and padding but excludes the border and margin.
  3. **Border Box**: The `width` and `height` properties include content, padding, and border. Only margin is excluded.
  4. **Margin Box**: Represents the outermost box, including content, padding, border, and margin.

- **Standard Box Model Calculation**:
  - Content Box: `width` = `content width` + `padding` * 2 + `border` * 2
  - Border Box: `width` = `border box width` - `padding` * 2 - `border` * 2 = `content width`

- **Recommended Usage**:
  ```css
  html { box-sizing: border-box; }
  *, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: inherit; }
  img { box-sizing: content-box; } /* Images shouldn't use border-box to prevent resizing issues */
  ```

- **Margin Collapsing**:
  - When vertical margins of adjacent elements overlap, the larger margin is used instead of adding them together. This is known as margin collapsing.

### 2. **Measuring Units**

- **Pixels (px)**:
  - 1px = 1/96th of 1 inch. It is a fixed length and does not scale with different screen resolutions.

- **Relative Units**:
  - **em**: Relative to the font size of the parent element. 
  - **rem**: Relative to the font size of the root element (`<html>`). More stable for responsive designs.
  - **Example**: Tailwind CSS uses `rem` as the basic unit for consistency and responsiveness.

### 3. **Flexbox**

Flexbox is a CSS layout model designed to manage one-dimensional layouts efficiently:

- **Main Axis and Cross Axis**:
  - **align-items**: Aligns flex items along the cross axis (vertical or horizontal depending on the flex direction).
    - Example: `align-items: center;`
  - **justify-content**: Aligns flex items along the main axis (horizontal by default).
    - Example: `justify-content: space-evenly;`

### 4. **Float**

The `float` property is used to position elements to the left or right within a container:

- **Example of Using Float**:
  - Applying special styles to the first letter of a paragraph:
    ```css
    .has-dropcap:first-letter {
      font-family: "Source Sans Pro", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
      float: left;
      font-size: 3rem;
      line-height: 0.65;
      margin: 0.1em 0.1em 0 0;
    }
    ```
  - The `float` function moves the first letter to the left, allowing text to wrap around it.
