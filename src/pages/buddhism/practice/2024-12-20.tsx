        <p>
          Today's experience is pretty precious. I finally could understand the
          feeling of '放下执着, 甚至对“进入”的执念'. at the beginning, i was
          trying to follow the routine of entering my imaginary world, but it
          somehow could not work. so i took myself back to the current me, who
          is sitting in the room mediatating, i am focusing on myself at that
          moment. i can feel my breath. i could also feel the existence of
          myself at that moment. its a good change. i will keep doing this. also
          i think to find the rythm to read nanmo阿弥陀佛 slowly also helps a
          lot. so i could finally find the inner peace inside me.
